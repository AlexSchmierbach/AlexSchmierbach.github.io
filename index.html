                I'm an upcoming Software Engineering graduate with a passion for building intuitive and scalable software solutions.
                I love tackling challenging problems and learning new technologies along the way. During my time at university,
                I worked on various projects dipping my toes in back-end & front-end development, database management and manipulation,
                while also dabbling in some Full Stack Development. I'm honestly not sure exactly what kind of specialization I know I want
                to have, but I have a strong urge to learn and no bias or opposition for one thing or another. I find myself quite
                comfortable in Java, Python, and C#. I enjoy working both in environments that are team oriented or have independent autonomy.
                I believe my interpersonal communication skills are highly effective in team environments, however my ability to hyper-focus
                on problems allows me to get the job done no matter the environment. I do believe that team environments allow for the best
                learning environment and I'm all about learning something new everyday along contributing to a wonderful engineering team.
                While I do enjoy anime and gaming as I spend most of my time on the computer to begin with. My music taste mostly reflect my
                emotional well being but I tend to gravitate towards Lofi Hip Hop, Metal, or rap. I find these types of music to be relaxing,
                allow for hyper focusing ability, or increased confidence. I tend to find myself most product when listening to Lofi Hip Hop
                or Rap. I do enjoy getting outside too by hiking at the nearest trail. I also enjoy some chill time by watching movies.
                I'm currently looking for an opportunity to grow and learn non stop to develop even better skills and make an impact in an
                innovative software team. Feel free to reach out!

                <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
                <h4>The Meat</h4>
                <p>
                    Completing the coursework throughout the program and developing this ePortfolio has helped showcased the strengths I
                    have by highlighting the things that I have gained a strong fundamental understanding of. The completion of this ePortfolio
                    took time, dedication, and persistence to adapt, grow, and continuously learn. Furthermore, it has allowed me to dedicate
                    my time more efficiently and effectively along with gaining a better understanding of the professional goals and values
                    that I hold myself accountable towards. The artifacts below help showcase the strengths I have within Software Engineering
                    and Design, Data Structures and Algorithms, along with Databases. 
                </p>
                <h4>The Potatoes</h4>
                <p>
                    Each artifact takes each of these topics further into detail and displays a starting point and a new ending point with
                    enhancements to build upon what was already created. In corresponding order, the first artifact showcases my ability to
                    understand the Software Development Lifecycle to design and engineer systems while keeping the entire cycle in mind
                    throughout development of a project along with key examples of documents that aid in this development. The second artifact
                    shows my ability to understand data structures and implement them within a real example. The third artifact shows my
                    ability to create a database, query said database and manipulate the data within that database through a mobile
                    application having to do with a user keeping track of their weight each day.

                <h3>Artifact One</h3>
                <p>
                    This artifact has to do with the course that I took known as CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle. This artifact has to
                    do with my fundamental understanding of the SDLC along with the various documentation, flowcharts & diagrams, and
                    methodologies that I learned about along the way. It was created quite a while ago during my first semester as SNHU if I
                    recall correctly a couple years ago. I chose to select this artifact for the portfolio because I think it is great to
                    highlight the large amount of understanding I have for the SDLC. While I don’t believe there is one specific component of
                    the artifact that showcases my skills and abilities as I believe the artifact showcases my level of understanding. The
                    artifact was improved upon by taking the knowledge that I have and developing that into an informative paper that
                    showcases that knowledge along with implementing common flowcharts & diagrams that are utilized within the Software
                    Engineering field.
                    According to the following course outcomes of:
                    <ul>1.	Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.</ul>
                    <ul>2.	Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.</ul>
                    I believe that I have hit the nail on the head so to speak for these outcomes.
                    I believe the most important thing I learned had to do with just how much knowledge I did retain along with how much I needed to remember. It was challenging, completely remembering everything and required some independent research since I don’t seem to have all the coursework that was done in the course which turned out to be the major challenge. This challenge was overcome by specific keyword research to attain the knowledge needed to develop this low-level opinionated understanding of the SDLC or Software Development Lifecycle.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Artifact Two</h3>
                <p>
                    This artifact has to do with the course that I took known as CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms. This artifact has to
                    with my fundamental understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms having to do more specifically with Doubly Linked
                    Lists. This data structure has always intrigued me so, I thought why not create a doubly linked list interface within the
                    command prompt to demonstrate the creation of a list, addition & deletion of nodes within the list along with manipulation
                    of the data within the nodes itself. These are all options a user of the application can go through. It was created today
                    as of writing this narrative on February 8th, 2025. The entire artifact showcases my skills and abilities in algorithms
                    and data structures. One could argue the creation of a doubly linked list could be the “base” artifact and the artifact
                    was improved by creating a user interface and options a user could use to manipulate the doubly linked list.
                    According to the following course outcomes of:
                    <ul>1.	Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.</ul>
                    <ul>2.	Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.</ul>
                    <ul>3.	Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.</ul>
                    <ul>4.	Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</ul>
                    I believe that I have hit the nail on the head so to speak for these outcomes.
                    I believe the most important thing I learned had to do with figuring out how I was going to layout the user interface within the command prompt for the user that is intuitive and easy to understand while still being appealing. I ended up with some neat little borders for decoration. Probably the most challenging part was attempting to find some course work related to this course to refresh some of my knowledge, however after doing a little research I was easily able to jump back into things without a problem. Especially when the strong intrigue of doubly linked lists came flooding back to my brain through this whole project when I couldn’t find any code related coursework for this artifact.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Artifact Three</h3>
                <p>
                    This artifact has to do with the course that I took known as CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. This artifact
                    has to do with my fundamental understanding of databases along with the implementation of database manipulation within an
                    android phone application. It allows the user to log in via a unique account and pull data previously saved but also
                    allows for new data to be saved that has to do with the weight the user inputs. So, it tracks the weight of the user as a
                    weight tracker app. The user can add, remove, edit and receive a text notification if they’d like whenever their current
                    weight is lower or higher depending on the specified goal. This item was selected because I thought it would be a good way
                    to showcase the use of a database within a real-world application. The entire artifact showcases my skills and abilities
                    in databases. The artifact was improved by properly updated the weights when they are added, removed, and edited.
                    According to the following course outcomes of:
                    <ul>1.	Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.</ul>
                    <ul>2.	Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.</ul>
                    <ul>3.	Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</ul>
                    I believe that I have hit the mark for each of these outcomes individually.
                    I believe the most important thing I have learned has to do with how difficult mobile development is and I think I won’t underestimate just how difficult it is and believe to have developed a newfound respect for mobile developers because the nuances are just amazing. The most challenging thing I faced had to do with properly updating the list of weights when they were being added and removed because editing wasn’t difficult at all, but with the other options there need to be a UI update immediately whenever a weight was added or removed. This proved challenging because I had to determine exactly where this needed to be done within the mobile environment.
